# Housing-price-prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features like crime rate, average number of rooms, and more. The dataset used is the Boston Housing dataset, which contains information about different houses and neighborhoods. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training using Linear Regression, and evaluation using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The goal is to understand key factors affecting house prices and build an accurate predictive model.
